The source code is divided into the files Classifier.py, DataSet.py and Driver.py.

* Driver.py : Implements the main driver for the application. This script tests Naive Bayes and Logistic regression classifiers using 3-fold cross-validation and compares the performance of the two classifiers and different sizes of the training dataset.

* Classifier.py : Implements algorithm for the Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers.

* DataSet.py : Implements data collection and partitioning logic to facilitate provisioning of training and test data in the k-fold cross validation testing.
